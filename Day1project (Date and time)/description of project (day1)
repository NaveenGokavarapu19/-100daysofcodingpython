In this project i have decided to solve problem based on date and time module


The resource which i am using is https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/date-time-exercise/index.php

The problems which i am interested are :

1)write a Python program to convert a date to the timestamp
2)Write a Python program to get last modified information of a file
3) Write a Python program to generate RFC 3339 timestamp.
